# Fiamma Bellezza

Music and dancing flame; HTML5 audio & WebGL experiment using Three.js.

Representing music in graphical form is both art and engineering. This web application generates graphics from musical composition, creating a visual effect based on sound frequencies that "dances" to the music.

The "flame" consists of 12 emitters, each emitting a number of sparks. For each keyframe an algorithm calculates spark lifetime, position and color for each given frequency and magnitude. The result movement reflects the physical properties of the audio.

*Requires Firefox 10 or newer and a modern GPU with accelerated drivers.*

**This code is released as-was in 2012 when I wrote this for Firefox 10**, using Mozilla Audio Data API. Chrome at the time did not have all the capabilities it now has.

**This does not run on browsers ca. 2016.**

Here are some screenshots of this back then.
