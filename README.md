# Fiamma Bellezza

Music and dancing flame; HTML5 audio & WebGL experiment using Three.js.

Representing music in graphical form is both art and engineering. This web application generates graphics from musical composition, creating a visual effect based on sound frequencies that "dances" to the music.

The "flame" consists of 12 spark emitters, each emitting a number of sparks. For each keyframe an algorithm calculates spark lifetime, position and color for each given frequency and magnitude. The result movement is reflects the physical properties of the audio. One royalty free track of classical music is offered this release.

*Requires Firefox 10 or newer and a modern GPU with accelerated drivers.*

**This code is released as-was in 2012 when I wrote this for Firefox 10.**

**This does not run on browsers ca. 2016.**

Here are some screenshots of this back then.
