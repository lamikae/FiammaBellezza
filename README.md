# Fiamma Bellezza

Music with dancing flames; HTML5 audio & WebGL experiment using Three.js.

Representing music in graphical form is both art and engineering. Here the target platform is WebGL on Mozilla Firefox browser, using the Mozilla Audio Data API.

The base visual consists of 12 spark emitters, each emitting a maximum of 64 sparks. Authored keyframes select the algorithms for spark lifetime, position and color for given frequency and magnitude. The result movement is composed from the physical properties of the music by the author.

*Requires Firefox 10 or newer and a modern GPU with accelerated drivers.*

**This code is released as-was in 2012 when I wrote this for Firefox 10.**

**This does not run on browsers ca. 2016.**
